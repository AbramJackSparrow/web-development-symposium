<br>
<p>Formula 1 fans were treated to an incredible season in 2024, but it seems the only racer able to beat Max Verstappen is his dad, and Carlos Sainz Jr just moved to williams, so 2025 is shaping up to be a repeat of 2023. But at least we are getting a F1 LEGO theme, exciting the most specific group in the world: Adults who collect LEGO and watch Formula 1. I'm incredibly excited about the line up, they are giving us a car from each team, as well as the worst pit crew the sport has to offer: Ferraris Pit Crew.

<p>Jokes aside, these sets look great, and the price is reasonable at only about $30/car. Each car is minifig scale. here are the details as listed on the LEGO website:

<p>I will personally be buying the Williams, Ferrari, and Redbull cars, Ferrari Pit Crew, the truck, and the garage. I may also buy the Kick car, because it's hilarious to me that the streaming platform that Jack Doherty crashed his car on, owns a race team.
