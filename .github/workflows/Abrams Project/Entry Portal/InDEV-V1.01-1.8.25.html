    <p3>This is version InDEV V1.01 1/8/25, it is for my personal use. I will be using this version, and making changes to it, until it is in a state that I'm happy with. Than I will be releasing it, and posting the link on this website. I will be updating the website every week or so, so if this is a project you are interested in, check in once in a while. I intend to release a public version sometime in early 2026</p3>
